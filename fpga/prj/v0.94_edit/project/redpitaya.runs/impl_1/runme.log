WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP pg_top/pg_ch_a/pid_reg_reg output pg_top/pg_ch_a/pid_reg_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
